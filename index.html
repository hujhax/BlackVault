            <p>Ancient, alien gods rising from the deep.  Blood-soaked sacrificial altars.  Townspeople half-transformed into ghastly fish.  These are just some of the  horrors that populate the works of horror master <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>.</p>

            <p>Tales from the Black Vault is a free horror audiodrama podcast inspired by these disturbing stories.  Every episode brings listeners into a new world of terror, fully brought to life with dialog, scoring, and unsettling sound effects. </p>

            <p>The podcast is improvised (yes, really!) in the studio by <a href="http://wiki.austinimprov.com/wiki/The_Black_Vault">The Black Vault</a>, a troupe of experienced theatrical improvisors who have been frightening audiences with improvised Lovecraft since 2012.</p>
